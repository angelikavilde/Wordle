# Wordle

## Overview
The project includes a mimic of a game called Wordle which is based on guessing the word by colour of the letters. The version presented here gives extra clue on the previous to the last turn. The clue is taken from the word description from the resource listed below.

## Limitations
Due to the project being fully made in python, it is harder to display the game to others who do not code or know how to work the terminal. It would have been more preferable to connect the code to the frontend code.

After reviewing a lot of the definitions of the words - it would seem that the dictionary API used was not describing certain words correctly and included some foreign words.

The original word data from the first resource below is only a small list of words which has also not been checked very well by me originally which caused the previous issue mentioned with the words included.

## Used resources

### The original word data was found using:
https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_dictionary.json

### All 5 letter words were processed through dictionary API to obtain their definitions using:
